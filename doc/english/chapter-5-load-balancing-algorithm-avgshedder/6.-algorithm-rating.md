# 6. Algorithm Rating

The series of experiments conducted before have already verified the excellent performance of `AvgShedder`:

* In heterogeneous environments, `AvgShedder` attempts to assign the heaviest load to the broker with the highest performance. This contrasts with [UniformLoadShedder + LeastLongTermMessageRate](../chapter-4-load-balancing-algorithm-experimental-verification/1.-uniformloadshedder-+-leastlongtermmessagerate.md#id-1.2-heterogeneous-environment), which unloads the bundles from high - performance brokers onto low - performance ones.
* Even when confronted with complex scenarios such as load fluctuations, the system can maintain stable operation. In our production environment, **only one bundle unload operation was triggered within a month**, whereas `ThresholdShedder` executed bundle unload operations **tens of times in a single day**.
* AvgShedder does not have the [over placement](../chapter-4-load-balancing-algorithm-experimental-verification/2.-thresholdshedder-+-leastresourceusagewithweight.md#id-2.2-over-placement-problem) and [over unloading problems](../chapter-4-load-balancing-algorithm-experimental-verification/2.-thresholdshedder-+-leastresourceusagewithweight.md#id-2.3-over-unloading-problem) faced by `ThresholdShedder + LeastResourceUsageWithWeight`, nor does it issue incorrect load balancing commands.
* The load - balancing speed is remarkably rapid. In the majority of cases, merely one or two bundle unload operations are required for the cluster to reach a stable state.
