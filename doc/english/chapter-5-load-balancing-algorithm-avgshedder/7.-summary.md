# 7. Summary

In this chapter, we have comprehensively elaborated on the design philosophy of `AvgShedder` and fully demonstrated its remarkable effectiveness. I completed the design and implementation of `AvgShedder` in 2022, and since then, it has been running stably in the production environment. In 2024, I contributed it to the community, and now, more and more companies are adopting it in their production environments and providing positive feedback.

In the forthcoming chapter, I will expound upon the optimal practices for Pulsar load balancing. I will present a straightforward and lucid operational guide, aiming to assist readers in attaining excellent load balancing outcomes and maximizing the benefits brought about by Pulsar's storage - computing separation architecture.
