# 4. Summary

In this chapter, we have comprehensively analyzed the three specific implementations of the `LoadSheddingStrategy`. However, the final load balancing effect depends not only on the shedding strategy but also on the placement strategy. Even if the shedding is correct, but the placement is wrong, the load balancing effect will still be greatly compromised. In the next chapter, we will delve into the implementation principles of the placement strategy and demonstrate the final outcomes achieved by different algorithm combinations.
