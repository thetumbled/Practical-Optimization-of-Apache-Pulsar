# 3. UniformLoadShedder

As analyzed earlier, neither `ThresholdShedder` nor `OverloadShedder` can address the issue of resource wastage by brokers with low load. Therefore, `UniformLoadShedder` was introduced.

Note: Although `ThresholdShedder` later added the `lowerBoundaryShedding` feature to address the issue of low-load brokers, this was after the introduction of `UniformLoadShedder`.



## **3.1 Highest and Lowest Loaded Brokers**

Below is a detailed introduction to the `UniformLoadShedder` algorithm. It first calculates the maximum and minimum message rates, maximum and minimum traffic throughput, and the corresponding brokers, as follows:

```
        MutableObject<String> msgRateOverloadedBroker = new MutableObject<>();
        MutableObject<String> msgThroughputOverloadedBroker = new MutableObject<>();
        MutableObject<String> msgRateUnderloadedBroker = new MutableObject<>();
        MutableObject<String> msgThroughputUnderloadedBroker = new MutableObject<>();
        MutableDouble maxMsgRate = new MutableDouble(-1);
        MutableDouble maxThroughput = new MutableDouble(-1);
        MutableDouble minMsgRate = new MutableDouble(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        MutableDouble minThroughput = new MutableDouble(Integer.MAX_VALUE);

        brokersData.forEach((broker, data) -> {
            double msgRate = data.getLocalData().getMsgRateIn() + data.getLocalData().getMsgRateOut();
            double throughputRate = data.getLocalData().getMsgThroughputIn()
                    + data.getLocalData().getMsgThroughputOut();
            if (msgRate > maxMsgRate.getValue()) {
                msgRateOverloadedBroker.setValue(broker);
                maxMsgRate.setValue(msgRate);
            }

            if (throughputRate > maxThroughput.getValue()) {
                msgThroughputOverloadedBroker.setValue(broker);
                maxThroughput.setValue(throughputRate);
            }

            if (msgRate < minMsgRate.getValue()) {
                msgRateUnderloadedBroker.setValue(broker);
                minMsgRate.setValue(msgRate);
            }

            if (throughputRate < minThroughput.getValue()) {
                msgThroughputUnderloadedBroker.setValue(broker);
                minThroughput.setValue(throughputRate);
            }
        });
```

Then, it calculates the differences between the maximum and minimum values. There are two thresholds, one for message rate and one for throughput size.

```
# Message-rate percentage threshold between highest and least loaded brokers for
# uniform load shedding. (eg: broker1 with 50K msgRate and broker2 with 30K msgRate
# will have 66% msgRate difference and load balancer can unload bundles from broker-1
# to broker-2)
loadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold=50

# Message-throughput threshold between highest and least loaded brokers for
# uniform load shedding. (eg: broker1 with 450MB msgRate and broker2 with 100MB msgRate
# will have 4.5 times msgThroughout difference and load balancer can unload bundles
# from broker-1 to broker-2)
loadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold=4
```

**Note**: The data type for both two configuration values is `double`.



```
double msgRateDifferencePercentage = ((maxMsgRate.getValue() - minMsgRate.getValue()) * 100)
                / (minMsgRate.getValue());
        double msgThroughputDifferenceRate = maxThroughput.getValue() / minThroughput.getValue();
```

*   **loadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold**: This is the percentage threshold for the difference in message rates between the most loaded and the least loaded brokers. The default value is 50.&#x20;

    * When the maximum message rate is 1.5 times the minimum message rate, bundle unloading can be triggered. For example, if the message rate of Broker 1 is 50K and the message rate of Broker 2 is 30K, the difference is `(50 - 30) / 30 = 66%`. In this case, the load balancer can unload bundles from Broker 1 to Broker 2.
    * Although the configuration description states that this is a percentage value, it can actually exceed 100, allowing for a larger difference between the maximum and minimum message rates. Let the maximum and minimum message rates be X and Y, respectively, and the threshold be P. The trigger condition is:
    $$
      \frac{X-Y}{Y} * 100 > P
      \Leftrightarrow
      X > (1+\frac{P}{100})Y
    $$
    When P is 100, it allows a maximum difference of one times.


*   **loadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold**: This is the multiplier threshold for the difference in throughput between the most loaded and the least loaded brokers. The default value is 4.&#x20;

    * When the maximum throughput is four times the minimum throughput, bundle unloading can be triggered. For example, if the throughput of Broker 1 is 450MB and the throughput of Broker 2 is 100MB, the throughput difference is `450 / 100 = 4.5` times. In this case, the load balancer can unload bundles from Broker 1 to Broker 2.
    * If the threshold is configured to a value not greater than 0, shedding based on message rate or throughput will be disabled; if both thresholds are met, shedding will prioritize based on message rate.

    ```
    boolean isMsgRateThresholdExceeded = conf.getLoadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold() > 0
                    && msgRateDifferencePercentage > conf.getLoadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold();
    boolean isMsgThroughputThresholdExceeded = conf.getLoadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold() > 0
                    && msgThroughputDifferenceRate > conf.getLoadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold();
    ```

    &#x20;

## **3.2 Selecting Bundles**

Next, calculate the amount of message rate/throughput corresponding to the bundles that need to be unloaded. The algorithm is as follows: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values multiplied by `maxUnloadPercentage`**, with a default value of 0.2.

```
        if (isMsgRateThresholdExceeded || isMsgThroughputThresholdExceeded) {
            MutableInt msgRateRequiredFromUnloadedBundles = new MutableInt(
                    (int) ((maxMsgRate.getValue() - minMsgRate.getValue()) * conf.getMaxUnloadPercentage()));
            MutableInt msgThroughputRequiredFromUnloadedBundles = new MutableInt(
                    (int) ((maxThroughput.getValue() - minThroughput.getValue())
                            * conf.getMaxUnloadPercentage()));
```

```
# In the UniformLoadShedder and AvgShedder strategy, the maximum unload ratio.
# For AvgShedder, recommend to set to 0.5, so that it will distribute the load evenly
#  between the highest and lowest brokers.
maxUnloadPercentage = 0.2
```





### **3.2.1 Based on message rate**

**If shedding is based on message rate**,  perform some checks, such as ensuring that the number of bundles on the overloaded broker is greater than 1, and that the total message rate to be unloaded reaches the threshold `minUnloadMessage`, which is configured by default to be `1000`.

```
if (isMsgRateThresholdExceeded) {
                LocalBrokerData overloadedBrokerData =
                        brokersData.get(msgRateOverloadedBroker.getValue()).getLocalData();
                if (overloadedBrokerData.getBundles().size() > 1
                        && (msgRateRequiredFromUnloadedBundles.getValue() >= conf.getMinUnloadMessage())) {
```

```
    @FieldContext(
            dynamic = true,
            category = CATEGORY_LOAD_BALANCER,
            doc = "In the UniformLoadShedder and AvgShedder strategy, the minimum message that triggers unload."
    )
    private int minUnloadMessage = 1000;
```

Note: this configuration is not included in `broker.conf`,  but does exist in `org.apache.pulsar.broker.ServiceConfiguration`.&#x20;

After passing the checks, start selecting bundles. The selection is also from largest to smallest, but with an additional constraint: the total number of bundles to be unloaded cannot exceed `maxUnloadBundleNumPerShedding`, which is unlimited by default.

```
    @FieldContext(
            dynamic = true,
            category = CATEGORY_LOAD_BALANCER,
            doc = "For each uniform balanced unload, the maximum number of bundles that can be unloaded."
                    + " The default value is -1, which means no limit"
    )
    private int maxUnloadBundleNumPerShedding = -1;
```



### **3.2.2 Based on throughput**

**If shedding is based on throughput,** similar checks are performed, ensuring that the amount of traffic to be unloaded is at least `minUnloadMessageThroughput`, with a default value of 1MB.

```
} else {
                LocalBrokerData overloadedBrokerData =
                        brokersData.get(msgThroughputOverloadedBroker.getValue()).getLocalData();
                if (overloadedBrokerData.getBundles().size() > 1
                        &&
                        msgThroughputRequiredFromUnloadedBundles.getValue() >= conf.getMinUnloadMessageThroughput()) {
                    // Sort bundles by throughput, then pick the bundle which can help to reduce load uniformly with
                    // under-loaded broker
```

```
    @FieldContext(
            dynamic = true,
            category = CATEGORY_LOAD_BALANCER,
            doc = "In the UniformLoadShedder and AvgShedder strategy, the minimum throughput that triggers unload."
    )
    private int minUnloadMessageThroughput = 1 * 1024 * 1024;
```

The logic for selecting bundles is essentially the same, so it will not be repeated here.



## **3.3 Evaluation**

After introducing the algorithm of `UniformLoadShedder`, we can clearly obtain the following information:

* **`UniformLoadShedder` does not have the problem of resource wastage by low-load brokers**. It considers the situation of low-load brokers, which is also the motivation for its introduction.
* **`UniformLoadShedder` does not handle load fluctuations.** For example, when traffic suddenly surges or drops sharply in a short period, it will adopt these load data points and trigger bundle unloading. However, the traffic of the topic will soon return to normal, which may trigger bundle unloading again. Such bundle unloading should actually be avoided. This scenario is quite common, as shown in the figure below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* In contrast, `ThresholdShedder` assigns a high weight to historical scores when scoring. Significant changes in resource usage do not immediately reflect in the load score, which requires multiple iterations to approach the resource usage. Therefore, it can handle scenarios with load fluctuations.

&#x20;

* `UniformLoadShedder` **does not rely on indicators such as CPU usage or network card usage to determine high-load and low-load brokers.** Instead, it judges based on message rate and throughput. In contrast, `ThresholdShedder` and `OverloadShedder`rely on machine resource indicators such as CPU usage.
  * If the machines in the cluster are heterogeneous, that is, if there are differences in the hardware configurations of different machines, or if the broker's machine shares resources with other processes, `UniformLoadShedder` is highly likely to misjudge high-load and low-load brokers. It may then migrate load from a high-performance, low-load broker to a low-performance, high-load broker. Therefore, **it is not recommended for users to use `UniformLoadShedder` in a heterogeneous environment.**
  * To illustrate with a simple example, if Broker 1 has twice the performance of Broker 2, and Broker 1 is handling a load of 150MB/s with a CPU usage of 40%, while Broker 2 is handling a load of 100MB/s with a CPU usage of 60%, `UniformLoadShedder` will still judge Broker 1 as the high-load broker and Broker 2 as the low-load broker, and migrate the load from Broker 1 to Broker 2. This is clearly a very wrong decision.

&#x20;

* `UniformLoadShedder` **only unloads bundles from one highest-load broker per shedding operation.** For large clusters, this may cause the cluster to **take a considerable amount of time to complete all load balancing tasks**.&#x20;
  * For example, if there are currently 100 high-load brokers in the cluster and 100 new machines are added, it is roughly estimated that 100 shedding operations are needed to complete the balancing task. However, since the execution interval of the `LoadSheddingStrategy` is determined by the configuration `loadBalancerSheddingIntervalMinutes`, which defaults to once per minute, it will take 100 minutes to complete all tasks. For users with large partition topics, their tasks are highly likely to experience multiple connection interruptions during these 100 minutes, which will undoubtedly have a very negative impact on user experience.
  * From a user experience perspective, when encountering occasional events such as broker scaling or user onboarding/offboarding that cause load increases or decreases, the ideal outcome is to quickly complete a load balancing operation and then basically not need to perform load balancing again, rather than continuously executing load balancing for a long time.
