# 2. Monitoring

Monitoring is essential for gaining insights into the performance of the load balancing algorithm. In this section, we will discuss the key metrics to monitor and how to interpret them.

# 2.1 unload bundle count
This metric indicates the total number of bundles that have been unloaded. When the value of this metric increases, it signifies that the load balancing algorithm is actively unloading bundles.
```
pulsar_lb_unload_bundle_count # before 2.11.0
pulsar_lb_unload_bundles_total # after 2.11.0
```

The metric name has changed from `pulsar_lb_unload_bundle_count` to `pulsar_lb_unload_bundles_total` since version 2.11.0 by PR: [Rename Pulsar lb metrics to specify OpenMetrics](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/16611).

note: this metric will only be exported by the leader broker, so you can **identify the leader broker** by checking the `pulsar_lb_leader_broker` metric.


# 2.2 bandwidth usage
```commandline
pulsar_lb_bandwidth_in_usage
pulsar_lb_bandwidth_out_usage
```

# 2.3 CPU usage
```commandline
pulsar_lb_cpu_usage
```

CPU usage is a critical metric to monitor. 


# 2.4 memory and direct memory usage
```commandline
pulsar_lb_memory_usage
pulsar_lb_direct_memory_usage
```

Though the direct memory usage metric and the memory usage metric are not closely related to the actual load, we still need to monitor them to avoid OOM errors.
