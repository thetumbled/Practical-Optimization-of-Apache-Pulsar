# 4. Summary

After a comprehensive and systematic analysis process, we have successfully identified the appropriate algorithm combination solutions. For the two algorithm combinations, we have scored them from multiple key dimensions such as adaptability, stability, and correctness, and finally formed a scoring table. With this table, we can intuitively and clearly see the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithm combinations.

Specifically, the combination of `ThresholdShedder + LeastResourceUsageWithWeight` performs poorly in terms of correctness and is highly prone to issues such as over placement and over unloading. The combination of `UniformLoadShedder + LeastLongTermMessageRate` has shortcomings in stability and adaptability, making it difficult to effectively cope with heterogeneous environments and short-term traffic fluctuations. In the next chapter, I will verify the results of this analysis through rigorous experiments.
