# Chapter 4 Load Balancing Algorithm - Experimental Verification

In this chapter, we will present a series of experimental data to validate the conclusions analyzed in the previous chapters. To reduce the burden of the validation work, we only conduct experiments on the two best combinations to verify the analysis in the previous chapters:

* ThresholdShedder + LeastResourceUsageWithWeight
* UniformLoadShedder + LeastLongTermMessageRate

The experimental process aims to enhance the reliability of the conclusions drawn in the previous analysis. If you are not interested in the experimental details, you may skip this chapter and navigate directly to Chapter 5, which covers the `AvgShedder`.
