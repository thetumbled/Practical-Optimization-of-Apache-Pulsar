# 2. ThresholdShedder + LeastResourceUsageWithWeight

## 2.1 **Environment Configuration**

A pulsar cluster was built with 5 brokers and 30 bookies.



The load balancing-related configurations are as follows:

```
loadBalancerLoadSheddingStrategy=org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ThresholdShedder
loadBalancerLoadPlacementStrategy=org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.LeastResourceUsageWithWeight
```



Using the combination of `ThresholdShedder` and `LeastResourceUsageWithWeight`, most of the configuration is set to default values, and the bundle split and even distribution features are also disabled.

```
loadBalancerDistributeBundlesEvenlyEnabled=false
loadBalancerAutoBundleSplitEnabled=false
loadBalancerAutoUnloadSplitBundlesEnabled=false
```



**2.2 Over Placement Problem**

Three pressure testing tasks were launched:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After starting the pressure testing tasks, it took 22 minutes for the cluster to reach a stable state and triggered 8 rounds of bundle unload.

&#x20;

To facilitate debugging, some logs were added. The log regarding the first bundle unload is presented as follows:

```
2024-06-11T15:33:42,642+0800 [pulsar-load-manager-1-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ThresholdShedder - brokerAvgResourceUsageWithoutHistory: {XXX.83:8081=0.6200548553466797, XXX.32:8081=0.6142524337768555, XXX.87:8081=0.34531837463378906, XXX.206:8081=0.6850704193115235, XXX.161:8081=0.4193758010864258}
```

This log line prints the **intermediate scores** of all brokers (i.e., the maximum resource utilization of each broker currently, **before using the historical weight scoring algorithm**). Evidently, brokers at addresses `XXX.83:8081`, `XXX.32:8081`, and `XXX.206:8081` are under high load, whereas the remaining two brokers are under low load.



```
2024-06-11T15:33:42,642+0800 [pulsar-load-manager-1-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ThresholdShedder - brokerAvgResourceUsage: {XXX.83:8081=0.146445592841173, XXX.32:8081=0.1780747564543283, XXX.87:8081=0.13442747117624326, XXX.206:8081=0.28951184996156754, XXX.161:8081=0.11923764428233738}, avgUsage: 0.1735394629431299, threshold: 0.1, minThroughputThreshold: 10.0MB
```

This log line prints the **final scores** (i.e., **the result of the historical scoring algorithm**), average score, and threshold for all brokers.

&#x20;

From the first two log lines, it can be seen that before starting the pressure testing tasks, the load on each broker was low, so the scores of all brokers at this time were significantly different from the actual load. Only the score of `XXX.206:8081` exceeded the threshold: `28.95% > 17.35% + 10.0%`. Consequently, a bundle unload operation was performed on it, giving rise to the following log:

```
2024-06-11T15:33:42,642+0800 [pulsar-load-manager-1-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ThresholdShedder - Attempting to shed load on XXX.206:8081, which has max resource usage above avgUsage  and threshold 28.951184996156755% > 17.35394629431299% + 10.0% -- Offloading at least 14.70925448705765 MByte/s of traffic, left throughput 208.25151973726722 MByte/s
```

&#x20;

Unload a bundle and immediately execute the placement policy `LeastResourceUsageWithWeight`:

```

```

Given that the sum of any broker's score and 10 is greater than the average score of 10.7%, the candidate broker list remains empty, thereby triggering random allocation. This is the issue we described with [`LeastResourceUsageWithWeight`](../chapter-3-load-balancing-algorithm-principles-and-analysis-placement-strategy/2.-leastresourceusagewithweight.md#id-2.1-candidate-broker-pool): **the candidate broker list can easily be empty, leading to random allocation**.

```

2024-06-11T15:33:42,663+0800 [pulsar-load-manager-1-1] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.impl.ModularLoadManagerImpl - [ThresholdShedder] Unloading bundle: public/default/0x70000000_0x80000000 from broker XXX.206:8081 to dest broker XXX.83:8081
```

As can be seen, the unloaded bundle was **assigned to the high-load broker** `XXX.83:8081`! This is a wrong load balancing decision. In this experiment, the probability of triggering this issue is extremely high, nearly inevitable. As depicted in the figure below, the problem has been triggered four times consecutively.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The [historical weight scoring algorithm](../chapter-2-load-balancing-algorithm-principles-and-analysis-load-shedding-strategy/1.-thresholdshedder.md#id-1.2-historical-weight-algorithm) also contributes to the high probability of occurrence. This is due to the fact that the criterion for choosing candidate brokers is that a broker's score must be 10 points lower than the average score. This implies that **there needs to be a considerable gap among the scores of different brokers.**&#x20;

However, owing to the historical - weight scoring algorithm, the scores of all brokers can only gradually approximate their real load starting from around 20, making it difficult for the scores of different brokers to widen the gap. As a result, the `LeastResourceUsageWithWeight` algorithm can only perform random allocation.



## **2.3 Over Unloading Problem**

To increase the load on a single broker, two brokers were shut down, and an abnormal load balancing was observed.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It can be seen that the yellow machine frequently switches between high-load and low-load states. Its CPU utilization descends from 80% to 40%, and then ascends back to 80%. In this process, the [over unloading problem](../chapter-3-load-balancing-algorithm-principles-and-analysis-placement-strategy/2.-leastresourceusagewithweight.md#id-2.2-historical-weight-algorithm) was first triggered, followed by the [over placement problem](../chapter-3-load-balancing-algorithm-principles-and-analysis-placement-strategy/1.-leastlongtermmessagerate.md#id-1.2-over-placement-issue).



Three rounds of load balancing were performed:

* In the first round, bundles were unloaded from the highest-load yellow machine `XXX.206:8081` to the green machine `XXX.83:8081`. However, four bundle unload operations were performed in this round, causing the load on the yellow machine `XXX.206:8081` to drop significantly and quickly become the broker with the lowest load, thus encountering the **over unloading problem**.
* In the second round, 11 bundles were unloaded from the highest-load blue machine `XXX.32:8081` and assigned to the high-load green machine `XXX.83:8081`and the low-load machine `XXX.206:8081`. In this process, the **over unloading problem** occurred again, and the blue machine `XXX.32:8081` became the broker with the lowest load. At the same time, there was also an **over placement problem**, as the bundle was mistakenly assigned to the high-load green machine `XXX.83:8081`.
* In the third round, the bundle was unloaded from the highest-load green machine `XXX.83:8081` and reloaded to the blue machine `XXX.32:8081`. The cluster then entered a balanced state, with the entire process taking a total of 30 minutes.

&#x20;

With the help of broker logs, we can gain a deeper insight into the above process:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Within the first 10 minutes of the first round of bundle unload, it can be observed that the system continously identified `XXX.206:8081` as a high-load broker and unloaded bundles from this node, eventually leading to the over unloading problem. This is due to the characteristics of the [historical weight scoring algorithm](../chapter-3-load-balancing-algorithm-principles-and-analysis-placement-strategy/2.-leastresourceusagewithweight.md#id-2.2-historical-weight-algorithm), which causes the score of `XXX.206:8081` to change very slowly. Even though the node has already unloaded the bundle and its real load has changed correspondingly, the score remains high, so it is still identified as a high-load broker and continues to be unloaded.

&#x20;

In the second round of bundle unload, bundles were unloaded from the highest-load `XXX.32:8081`. However, an **over placement problem** was encountered as these bundles were unloaded to another high - load server, `XXX.83:8081`.

```

```



Up to this point, we have experimentally verified the two core defects of `ThresholdShedder + LeastResourceUsageWithWeight`:

* Over placement problem
* Over unloading problem

Both issues are exacerbated by the historical weight scoring algorithm. It is also evident that the load-balancing speed of `ThresholdShedder + LeastResourceUsageWithWeight` is slow. Due to incorrect load balancing decisions, the system often needs to perform load-balancing repeatedly to eventually reach a stable state.
